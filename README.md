# HT_Analytics_Portfolio
## [Project 1: House_Price_Prediction]()
### Background Information:
* **This is the project on which I am trained on during Machine Learning in Python Certification programme in National University of Singapore(NUS)**
  
### **Data Preparation and Exploration:**
1. **Handling missing values, outlier detection using boxplot and drop off the unrelated features**  
2. **Data-types change to suite the machine learning algorithum**
3. **EDA such as seaborn and maplotlib (Eg.heatmap correlation)**
   
### **Machine Learning Model:**
* **Machine Learning Models such as linear regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM and Random Forest**
* **Summary to shown best models to apply**
* **Save and load the new data set for predictions**
* **Save with sklearn_version**

* ### **Insight and recommendation**
1. **sqft_living and sqft_above have higher impact on price fluatuation**
  
## [Project 2: KC_House_Price_Prediction]()
### Background Information:
* **Dataset is sourced from Kaggle and navigate ways to derive the insight from this dataset base on the house_price_prediction mentioned above**
  
### **Data Preparation and Exploration:**
1. **Feature engineered the date YYYY-MM-DD into separate year, month, week and date of week**
2. **Further probe into this, Plot out the price of house in each city using the given longtitude and latitude**
   
### **Machine Learning Model:** 
* **Apply Tensorflow and Keras as a Machine Learning Models and Sequential Neutral Network for deep learning to train the model**

### **Insight and recommendation**
1. **House near the bay is more expensive as indicated by the color map**
2. **House price is linearly increase annually and average price near shore is much more expensive**
  
## [Project 3: Lending_Club_Prediction]()
### Background Information: 
* **Create machine learning model to decide on the loan application based on the
  applicant's background and status**
  
### **Data Preparation and Exploration:**
**Plot and find the correlationship between parameters using heatmap**
* **1. Feature engineering graph to divide grade into sub-grade**
**Show the percentage of fully paid and charged off vs various
employment length**
* **Explorary Data Analysis(EDA), filling NA values, handling classification task and feature engineering.**
* **Handling missing values:**
**- Replace missing/NAN values with mean of highly correlated feature per target category**
**- Inspect missing values and drop off the unneccessary values**
* **Categorical Handling**
  
### **Machine Learning Model:**
* **Using deep learning model such as Tensorflow and keras**
**- Pandas dummy variable to categorize the categorical features**
**- Evaluate the model using confusion matrix and classification report**

### **Insight and recommendation**
1. **Those people with longer employment length are less likely to get charged off**
  
## [Project 4: Ham_and_Spam_SMS_Predictions]()
### Background Information: 
* **For this project, it is a prediction that predict SMS message is Ham(Not junk) or Spam and the model will predict whether the new input message is a Ham or Spam.**

### **Machine Learning Model:**
* **Apply machine learning techniques such as NLTK, stopwords, countvectorizer, TFIDF and punctuation removal**
* **Construct pipeline for future usage**
  
### **Insight and recommendation**
1. Longer text length has higher tendency of spam message**
  
## [Project 5: Recommender System for Movie]()
### Background Information:
* **This model will suggest highly correlated movie based on collaborative filtering.**

### **Data Preparation and Exploration:**
* **EDA, Pivot table and merge between two data sets

### **Insight and recommendation**
1. **The ratings and number of ratings has the tendency to increase especially for popular movie like Star Wars. And star wars movie's rating and number of rating has very high correlation with
follow-up star wars movie which also has high number of rating and rating**
  
## [Project 6: Titanic_Survival_Rate]()
### Background Information: 
* **This project predicts the survival rate based on sex, age, classes, cabins and other various factors**
  
### **Data Preparation and Exploration:**
* **Basic data analytics techniques are used such as EDA and Scatter Plot and handling NA values**

### **Insight and recommendation**
1. **Female tends to have higher survival rate than male.**
